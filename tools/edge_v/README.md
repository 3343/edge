EDGE Velocity (EDGE-V) is a tool used to annotate the meshes with velocity model data. It is developed based on [Unified Community Velocity Model](http://scec.usc.edu/scecpedia/UCVMC)(UCVM), which is the data source, and [Mesh-Oriented datABase](http://sigma.mcs.anl.gov/moab-library)(MOAB).

EDGE-V is released as an open-source scientific software under the BSD3 software license.

Details on how to use EDGE-V are given in EDGE's [user guide](http://usr.dial3343.org).
