# EDGÆŽ-V


EDGE-V is a tool to process meshes.
As a library it is used to read meshes and their supporting data structures, e.g., time stepping or MPI information.
As a standalone program it is also used to partition meshes, derive supporting data structures, and write size-fields for velocity-aware mesh refinement.

Details on how to use EDGE-V are given in EDGE's [user guide](http://usr.dial3343.org).
